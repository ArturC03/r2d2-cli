# R2D2 Examples

This directory contains two demonstration projects to showcase R2D2's capabilities:

## CLI Example

The CLI example demonstrates basic R2D2 functionality in a command-line interface. It shows:
- String operations
- Basic math operations
- Conditional statements
- Loop constructs

To run the CLI example:
```bash
./r2d2-cli run examples/cli/demo.r2d2
```

## Web Example

The web example showcases R2D2's JavaScript integration capabilities. It demonstrates the same features as the CLI example but in a web interface.

To run the web example:
1. Ensure you have a web server running
2. Open `examples/web/index.html` in your browser
3. Click the "Run Demo" button to see the R2D2 code in action

The web example features a modern, responsive design with gradient backgrounds and smooth animations.
